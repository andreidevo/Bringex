### Hi there 👋

I'm Flutter Developer (1+ year) and UI Designer (1-2 years), 
kotlin/java in past (2+ years of exp)

My plans:

- 🔭 Finish my portfolio proj with opensource code for show
- 🌱 Develop app with 50.000 downloads (18.000 already exist)
- 👯 Have independent income
- 🤔 oddly enough I want to know better English
- ⚡️ And I want to travel around the world!
